It builds on some of the policies that have already been put in place over the last couple of years, which they say have led to some positive gains in the economy and aims to consolidate those gains for inclusive green growth. The government hopes to achieve this by investing in the core pillars of the BETA agenda, such as agriculture, small businesses, housing, healthcare, and digital infrastructure. They want to use a value chain approach to enhance production, market access, and attract investments. They also plan to continue with reforms to improve governance, transparency, and responsibility in how public money is used. They seek to promote clean energy, reduce reliance on imports, and support local industries. The government also plans to increase revenue collection through tax base expansion, digitalization of tax processes, and tackling tax loopholes. Emphasis will be placed on fiscal consolidation which includes expenditure rationalization and revenue mobilization efforts.  The government also plans to increase transparency and accountability by digitizing procurement and making it open and transparent. The government aims to transition from cash-based accounting to accrual-based accounting, which will provide more accurate financial reporting.

The government also wants to promote Private-Public-Partnerships (PPPs) to bring in private sector investment into public projects. The government intends to improve the business environment for businesses and investment, reduce the cost of living, and enhance the wellbeing of all Kenyans, through a tight fiscal stance aimed at reducing debt vulnerabilities. The government aims to create a stronger, more reliable revenue stream while protecting those most affected by economic shocks. The government will also sustain efforts to strengthen accountability, transparency and a revenue mobilization path guided by the Medium-Term Revenue Strategy – that makes tax regime more efficient, equitable, and progressive. The government is committed to improve efficiency and effectiveness in public spending, and to operationalize the Public Investment Management Information System to automate public investment management processes.

However, if corruption and lack of transparency are not addressed, it may not have a significant positive impact on the lives of citizens. The effort to streamline legal processes may also improve access to justice. However, if these efforts are not implemented effectively, they could fail to achieve their intended purpose."

The new health insurance system requires Kenyans to contribute to the system, which will impact their monthly finances. The government's efforts to improve the business environment could lead to more opportunities for wealth creation. The planned tax reforms could impact the finances of individuals, depending on their income levels and consumption patterns. Additionally, the easing of monetary policy may reduce borrowing costs, increasing access to finances for individuals and businesses. However, the plan to prioritize paying off pending bills could lead to cash flow challenges for some individuals and businesses that are owed money by the government."
